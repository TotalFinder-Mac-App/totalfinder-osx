## What is TotalFinder?  

**TotalFinder** is an advanced **Finder enhancement utility** that transforms the way you manage files on your Mac. It introduces a suite of productivity-focused tools that extend Finder’s capabilities, including tabs, dual-pane navigation, color tagging, and file organization shortcuts.  

Unlike the default Finder, TotalFinder is built to improve multitasking and workflow efficiency. With **tabbed browsing**, you can open and switch between multiple directories in a single window. The **dual-panel mode** allows side-by-side folder comparison, making drag-and-drop file management intuitive and fast.  

The application also includes features such as **folder merging**, **hidden file toggling**, and **clipboard-based actions**, all designed to reduce repetitive steps in your workflow. Custom labels, sorting options, and global hotkeys give users the flexibility to work faster while keeping the Finder interface familiar and lightweight.  

Optimized for **modern macOS and Apple Silicon**, TotalFinder runs smoothly across all systems. It’s an ideal solution for developers, designers, and everyday users who want a more capable, efficient, and personalized Finder experience.
